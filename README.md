# SentinelAI

AI-Powered User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) Platform for Insider Threat Detection

## Overview

SentinelAI is an AI-driven Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to detect insider threats by learning user behavior and identifying anomalous activities using unsupervised machine learning.

The system combines behavioral profiling, feature engineering, anomaly detection, risk scoring, and dashboard visualization to help organizations identify suspicious user activities before they become security incidents.

## Dataset

The project uses a synthetic enterprise user activity dataset generated using the Faker library.

The dataset simulates:

- Employee login activities
- VPN usage
- Failed login attempts
- File access behavior
- Database queries
- Data transfer volume
- Insider threat scenarios

---
## Dashboard Visualisation
- Admin view
- Analyst View and report generation
- Admin and Analyst can both view interactive dashboard with risk trend
- Alerts are visible
- Visualisation of detected anomalies
- Current risk trajectory compared to the normal range visibility
- View of generated reports on the user behaviours
- Notification channels

## Machine Learning Pipeline

- Data Understanding & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering & Extraction
- Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)
- Graph Construction & Neighborhood Aggregation
- Graph Neural Network Classification (GraphSAGE)
- Model Evaluation

---

## Results

Example evaluation metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Future Scope

- Autoencoders for reconstruction loss anomalies
- Explainable AI (XAI) for GNN models (e.g., GNNExplainer)
- Real-time log streaming
- SIEM integration
- SOAR automation
- Multi-model ensemble detection
